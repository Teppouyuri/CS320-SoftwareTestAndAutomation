How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
Making sure the code works and is secure involves testing it well and following good security practices. I used different tests to catch mistakes and regularly updated the code to stay secure.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
Understanding what users want is crucial. I talked to users a lot, used tools like user stories, and got feedback to make sure the program really met their needs. It's an ongoing process of talking, understanding, and improving.

How do I approach designing software?
Designing software is like planning and solving a puzzle. I start by understanding the problem and making clear goals. Breaking the software into smaller parts and planning well helps in creating an organized program. I focus on things like making it easy to maintain and ensuring it works well for users. Regularly checking and improving the design helps in creating a strong and well-made software solution.
